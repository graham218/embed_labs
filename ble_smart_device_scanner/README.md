## 🧠 State Management

> Powered by **Riverpod** for structured and reactive state updates.

- **`ScanProvider`** handles BLE scanning streams.
- **`DeviceProvider`** manages connections and device services.
- Each layer is modular and reusable — ideal for scaling IoT-based Flutter apps.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| 🧱 Android 12+ Bluetooth permissions | Used `permission_handler` with user-friendly prompts. |
| ⚡ Real-time updates | Leveraged `StreamBuilder` for BLE scan/connection streams. |
| 💻 Screen Responsiveness | `LayoutBuilder` adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. |
| 🏭 Manufacturer details | Integrated `Device Information Service` for metadata. |
| 🔁 Auto Reconnect | Implemented retry logic with safe fallback on failure. |
